# predicting_automatabiltiy_of_work_tasks

Can we predict the automatability of occupational tasks in the same way that we predict movie ratings? 

In this project, I use universal sentence encoding to try and predict the automatability (i.e. suitability for machine learning scores) of a new occupational tasks from rated occupational tasks.
